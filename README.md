Websites-Portfolio
==================

A collection of websites I have helped make/design.


There are two versions of the WICS website I designed by updating an existing design, so I only edited the HTML and CSS, not the javascript. Each of the two versions have a screenshot in this folder. I don't currently have these versions of the website uploaded on the internet, so to demo them live, please download each folder separately and then open "index.html."


Images
========
The images folder contains computer graphics I made using Gimp and paintbrush.
